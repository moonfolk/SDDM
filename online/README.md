#SDM

###Usage:
First change the *paths* variables in *sdm.sh* to be the paths corresponding to  *input data folder* and *output folder*

Run *SDM* using the *hyperparameters*  described in the paper:

>
    ./sdm.sh

Modify other variables such as *NUM_CORES* (number of cores used to run the program) and hyperparameters
(e.g., *TAU0*, *TAU1*, *GAMMA*, etc) in *sdm.sh* accordingly if needed.
