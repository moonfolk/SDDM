#DM

###Usage:
First change the *paths* variables in *dm.sh* to be the paths corresponding to
*input data folder* and *output folder*

Run *DM* using the *hyperparameters*  described in the paper:

>
    ./dm.sh

Modify other variables such as *NUM_CORES* (number of cores used to run the program) and hyperparameters
(e.g., *TAU1*, *GAMMA*, etc) accordingly if needed.
